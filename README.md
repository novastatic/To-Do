# To-Do
Project BBS - LF 09

# About the project
* A server application is to be created with the help of which todo lists with corresponding entries can be created and edited. 
* Each list consists of a number of entries and is assigned to a user.
* Each entry of a todo list consists of an ID, a name, an optional description and the assignment to a todo list and the assignment to a todo list and a user. 
* Each todo list and user has a name in addition to the ID.
* The interface must make it possible to create new lists and delete existing lists and delete existing lists. 
* All entries in the list can be loaded via an end point. 
* It must also be possible to add and delete entries in lists. 
* To the list owners, new users must be added and deleted and a list of all existing users must be queried via a list of all existing users.
* Authentication is not to be planned or implemented initially. For security reasons, however, no consecutive numbers should be used for all IDs. Instead, random GUIDs are used.
